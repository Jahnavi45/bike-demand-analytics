# Predictive Analytics for Rental Bike Demand Management

This project uses predictive analytics and machine learning to forecast rental bike demand based on various features such as weather conditions, seasonality, and working days.

## Project Components

- *Dataset:* Bike Sharing Dataset (Daily)
- *Tools Used:* Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, SQL
- *Model:* Linear Regression for prediction

## Files Included
- bike_demand_analysis.ipynb – Jupyter Notebook with EDA and ML model
- bike_sharing_analysis.sql – SQL queries for basic data exploration
- README.md – Project overview

## Results
The linear regression model achieved a good R² score, showing a strong correlation between weather factors and bike demand.

## Future Scope
Future improvements could include deep learning models, time series analysis (LSTM), and real-time prediction systems.
